# PaymentForm

This app contains two handy Lightning Web Components - a credit card validator and an address input validator.
Used together, they should cover most use cases that need credit card and address input.

Massive thanks to Jessie Pollack whose library I heavily borrowed to make this lwc based app.

Note, the containing app is an AURA app, which the individual CC and Address input forms are full LWC Components.
I haven't been bothered converting the containing app or component to Aura, but it should be pretty easy really.
